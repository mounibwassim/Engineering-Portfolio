## 💻 Local Development Guide

Follow these steps to get your local development environment up and running smoothly.

### 1. Install Dependencies
Quickly install the required packages using `pnpm`.
```bash
pnpm install
```

### 2. Push Database Schema
Ensure your `.env` variables are correctly configured, then push the Drizzle ORM schemas directly to your Supabase PostgreSQL instance.
```bash
pnpm db:push
```

### 3. Start the Development Server
Launch the Next.js local server with Turbopack enabled.
```bash
pnpm dev
```
Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application in your browser.

> **Important:** You must run `pnpm dev` in your terminal to start the local server before clicking the links below.

## 🛡 Admin Panel Access

Arithma features a robust Super-Admin interface to manage users, features, and system configurations.

### Generating the Default Admin Account
Before accessing the admin panel, you must inject your admin credentials into the database. We provide a utility script to accomplish this safely.

1. Verify or customize your login credentials in `scripts/add-admin.ts`.
2. Execute the injection script to create the account:
   ```bash
   npx tsx scripts/add-admin.ts
   ```

### Accessing the Dashboard
Once the account is created, you can access the secure portal locally:
- **URL:** [http://localhost:3000/admin](http://localhost:3000/admin)
- Log in utilizing the credentials generated by the script to gain full Super-Admin privileges.
